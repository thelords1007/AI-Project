# **Artificial Intelligence Project - Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)**

# Picture-in-Picture Mode

> This feature would help students segregate the instructor’s presentation and code side-by-side with the instructor on their IDE, giving them a great learning experience. The code for implementing this feature is available in PIP folder.

# Real-Time Answering of Questions Asked by Students

> The doubts of students can be cleared in a fraction of a second as and when they are asked in a chatbox by posting the reference links to the student’s questions. The code for implementing this feature is available in RTA.py file.

# PDF of Lecture Notes

>There are several times when a professor writes on the slides and the students cannot note them down. So, our extension would form the pdf file of the complete lecture slides along with the notes written on them by the professor, which the students could use as a reference at a later point in time. The code for implementing this feature is available in PDF.py file.
